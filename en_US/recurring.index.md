This shows you all recurring transactions.

Recurring transactions can be used to make Firefly III automatically create transactions for you. In order for it to work, you must have a cron job running that creates these transactions for you.

Read more about recurring transactions in [the official documentation](https://firefly-iii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/recurring.html).

**Cron job**

In order to actually create the transactions automatically, you need to set up a cron job. You can read about that on the [page in the official documentation about cron jobs](https://firefly-iii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/cronjob.html).
