Firefly III supports "rules": Small building blocks of actions that are triggered when a transaction is created or updated.

If your transaction has certain properties (called "triggers") Firefly III will execute the "actions". Combined, you can make Firefly III respond in a certain way to transactions.

On this page you see your rule groups, and the rules they contain. If you have no rules or rule groups, Firefly III will create a default rule and rule group, as an example.

You can sort the rule triggers, and the rule actions. If you create a rule, the help page will show you what's possible.

Each rule and each rule group can be executed on your transactions to see if they work and how they work.

To see how a rule works, press **New rule**.
