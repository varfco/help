This shows you a list of all your piggy banks. Piggy banks can be used to divide the money in an asset account into several "piggy banks". This makes it easy to save money.

For example, you could have two piggy banks, both linked to your savings account:

1. One for "a new TV" with a target amount of 500,-
2. Another for "a new PC" with a target amount of 1000,-.

Assuming you have 900,- in your savings account, you can divide this money between both piggy banks as you see fit:

1. 500,- for the TV and 400,- for the PC.
2. 450,- for the TV and 450,- for the PC.
3. 500,- for the TV and nothing for the new PC, leaving 400,- to be divided.

This can help you organise your savings.
