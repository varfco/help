This report shows you an overview of your finances. The content is different depending on the range you have selected.

### Range of a month or less

The report starts with a chart showing the balances of your accounts over time. Then, two boxes with account balances and income vs. expenses. Below those two boxes, a box that lists all your income (on the left) and a box that lists all your expenses (on the right).

Then, an overview of your budgets and categories in this month. The budget box includes the amounts you've actually budgeted.

Below those two boxes, a budget box "split by account" that shows which asset accounts you have spent money from, and in which budget.

Finally, a box showing the status of all relevant bills for this reporting period.

### Range of more than a month

The report starts with a chart showing the balances of your accounts over time. The chart on the left shows the average income and expenses. Then, two boxes with account balances and income vs. expenses. Below those two boxes, a box that lists all your income (on the left) and a box that lists all your expenses (on the right).

Then, a chart shows your "net worth", ie. all of your asset accounts combined over time.

Below that a list of your budgets is visible with the expenses per month listed. Click the title and below the list, and a chart will appear below the box. Click the arrow-icon, and you will be taken to the budget page.

The same goes for the list of categories below the budget chart. There are two boxes (and two charts) for the categories: for income and expenses.
